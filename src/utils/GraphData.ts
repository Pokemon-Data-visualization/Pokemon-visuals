I know at this stage it might be lingering in your mind that why is the “pokemon type” important for our story?  Well, let’s see.. As a player, knowing the types of both your own Pokémon and your opponent's Pokémon is critical because certain types are more effective against others. For example, a Water type Pokémon will deal more damage to a Fire type Pokémon, while an Electric type Pokémon will be weak against Ground type Pokémon which make us understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types. But what is the attack-defense ratio for the different types of pokemon?",

It possesses Poison as its primary type, which represents its poisonous abilities and attacks. With the secondary Grass type, Roserade gains characteristics related to plants and nature.
