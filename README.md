## Thought process behind the Project
Pokémon, a beloved cartoon series, has captured the hearts of fans across all age groups. The diverse range of Pokémon, each with its unique powers and abilities, coupled with the captivating journeys alongside their trainers, make for an incredibly fascinating experience.

In line with this enthusiasm, a remarkable project was born during the AngelHack hackathon—a Pokémon Dashboard created from scratch. This initiative aimed to bring together the world of Pokémon into a comprehensive and interactive platform.

Through this project, passionate Pokémon enthusiasts can immerse themselves in the fascinating details of their favorite Pokémon, discover their strengths and weaknesses, and gain a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanics within the Pokémon universe.


## Data Story

### Section 1: Unleashing the Powerhouses
- Visualize the distribution of Pokémon types and highlight the most common and rare types.
- Showcase the top Pokémon with the highest total stats and examine their attributes.
- Discuss the impact of stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed on a Pokémon's overall strength.

### Section 2: A Game of Evolution
- Explore the concept of Pokémon evolution and how it affects their battling abilities.
- *(Note: Unfortunately, the Pokémon dataset used for this analysis lacks a "Generation" column, preventing us from visualizing the Pokémon evolution.)*
- Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of evolving Pokémon and the strategic considerations for trainers.

### Section 3: Type Matchups: The Key to Victory
- Dive into the complex world of type matchups and how they influence battles.
- Create interactive visualizations that showcase the strengths and weaknesses of different Pokémon types.
- Discuss the strategies trainers can employ to exploit type matchups and gain a competitive edge.

### Section 4: Generational Shifts
- Compare Pokémon attributes across different generations to identify trends and shifts in battling strategies.
- Highlight the introduction of new Pokémon types and their impact on the battle meta.
- Analyze how the evolution of Pokémon battling has shaped the choices and strategies of trainers throughout the generations.

## Note
- The Pokémon dataset used for this analysis might be limited, as it lacks a "Generation" column, preventing us from visualizing the Pokémon evolution effectively. This "Generation" information is crucial for tracing the evolution paths of popular Pokémon and showcasing the changes in their stats over time.
- Despite this limitation, we have made every effort to present comprehensive insights into the strengths and evolution of Pokémon battling strategies based on the available data.
